What Are KV v1 and v2?
Vault’s KV secrets engine lets we store key-value pairs (like username: sampleuser). It comes in two versions:

    KV v1 (Version 1):
        The older, simpler version.
        Stores secrets as a flat JSON object at a given path.
        No versioning (we can’t keep old versions of a secret).
        When we write to a path, it overwrites everything at that path with the new data.
    KV v2 (Version 2):
        Newer, more advanced version (introduced around Vault 1.0).
        Adds versioning (keeps old versions of secrets) and metadata (like creation time).
        Stores secrets in a nested structure with a data sub-object and separate metadata.
        Supports additional features like soft deletion and version recovery.

our Vault instance (v1.19.0) supports both, but the version depends on how the secrets engine is mounted.
How Their Structures Differ
KV v1 Response
When we read a secret from a KV v1 mount, the JSON looks flat:

```json

{
  "request_id": "some-id",
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "lease_duration": 2764800,
  "data": {
    "API": "sampleAPI",
    "password": "samplepass",
    "username": "sampleuser"
  },
  "wrap_info": null,
  "warnings": null,
  "auth": null,
  "mount_type": "kv"
}
```

    Secrets are directly under "data".
    No nesting, no versioning info.

KV v2 Response
For KV v2, the response is nested:
```json

{
  "request_id": "some-id",
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "API": "sampleAPI",
      "password": "samplepass",
      "username": "sampleuser"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "created_time": "2025-03-14T12:00:00Z",
      "deletion_time": "",
      "destroyed": false,
      "version": 1
    }
  },
  "wrap_info": null,
  "warnings": null,
  "auth": null
}
```
    Secrets are under "data"."data".
    There’s a "metadata" section with versioning info.

Writing Data

    KV v1: vault kv put secrets/my-secret key=value writes a flat object.
    KV v2: vault kv put secrets/data/my-secret key=value writes to the data/ endpoint, and Vault manages versions.

Why It Mattered for our Code
In our case:

    Raw Response: {"data": {"API": "sampleAPI", "password": "samplepass", "username": "sampleuser"}, ...}
    Observation: No nested "data"."data" or "metadata", suggesting KV v1-like behavior.
    Initial Code Issue: I assumed KV v2 (root.path("data").path("data")), so it couldn’t find the secrets. Fixing it to root.path("data") worked because our structure is flatter.

But our CLI command vault kv put secrets/data/SampleApp/config uses the data/ path, which is typically KV v2. This is confusing, so let’s figure out what’s really going on.
How to Figure Out Which Version we’re Using
we can check the secrets engine version with these steps:
1. List Mounted Secrets Engines
Run this CLI command:
bash

vault secrets list -detailed

Output might look like:
```

PPath          Type     Accessor              Description  Options           ...
----          ----     --------              -----------  -------           ...
secrets/      kv       kv_abc123             n/a          map[version:1]    ...

```
    Path: Look for secrets/ (our mount point).
    Options: If it says version:1, it’s KV v1. If version:2, it’s KV v2.
    Type: Will say kv for both, so focus on Options.

2. Check the Mount Type in Response
our raw response already shows "mount_type": "kv", but it doesn’t specify v1 or v2. The structure (flat "data") strongly suggests KV v1.
3. Test with CLI

    KV v1 Behavior:
    bash

    vault kv put secrets/SampleApp/config foo=bar
    vault kv get secrets/SampleApp/config

    If it works without data/ and overwrites everything, it’s likely v1.
    KV v2 Behavior:
    bash

    vault kv get -version=1 secrets/data/SampleApp/config

    If this works and supports -version, it’s v2. If it errors out, it’s not v2.

our Case

    we used vault kv put secrets/data/SampleApp/config, which is KV v2 syntax.
    But the API response lacks the nested "data"."data" and "metadata", which is KV v1-like.
    Hypothesis: our secrets/ mount might be KV v1, but we’re using KV v2 CLI commands, and Vault is adapting the response. Or, the mount is v2, but configured to return data in a simpler format.

Confirming with our Setup
Since our read and write are working now, let’s confirm:

    Run:
    bash

    vault secrets list -detailed

    Look at the secrets/ entry and share the Options field (e.g., map[version:1] or map[version:2]).
    Try:
    bash

    vault kv metadata get secrets/data/SampleApp/config

        If it returns metadata (e.g., version info), it’s KV v2.
        If it errors with "unknown command" or "path not found," it’s likely v1.

Quick Summary

    KV v1: Flat structure, no versioning, simpler.
    KV v2: Nested structure, versioning, more features.
    our Setup: Looks like KV v1 based on the response, despite using data/ (KV v2 path). We’ll confirm with the above commands.
    Code Fix: Using root.path("data") works for v1, while root.path("data").path("data") is for v2.
